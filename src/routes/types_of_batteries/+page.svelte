<h4>Types of Batteries</h4>

<div>
	The common battery types are AGM, Gel, Lead acid, Listium Ion and Lithium
	LifeP04.
</div>
<h4>We recomend LifePO4</h4>

Most of the time we recomend Lithium LifePO4 batteries because they can last 10
years, they are economically competitive per watt hour and they don't offgas
toxic chemicals so you can store then in a space where you live.

	<h4>Lithium LifePO4 Cells</h4>
	If you are a DIY (do it yourself) type here is where we like to buy our LIfePO4

<h4>
	Be warned, there are many accounts online of people deeply regreting buying
	cells from oversea companies with no USA physical presence and getting
	damaged repackaged LIfePO4 cells. There often is little recourse to
	returning the batteries.

	<h4>LifePO4 Server Rack Battery</h4>
	If you like fast and easy pre-made battery packs are a better option. They are
	more expensive and often have a warrenty.
